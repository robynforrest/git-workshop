This will explain how to merge Martell's IPHC-developer branch into yours.

Assuming you have executed these commmands:
git clone https://github.com/your-github-name/iSCAM
git remote add smartell https://github.com/smartell/iSCAM
git remote add cgrandin https://github.com/cgrandin/iSCAM
git fetch smartell
git fetch cgrandin

Take a look at ALL remote branches in the repository, including the cached remote branches,
it should look something like this:

git branch -r

  smartell/CAPAM
  smartell/IPHC
  smartell/IPHC-developer
  smartell/LNclass
  smartell/PacificHerring
  smartell/SOKherring
  smartell/SilverHake
  smartell/developer
  smartell/equilibrium
  smartell/gh-pages
  smartell/halibut
  smartell/master
  smartell/twoSexPar
  cgrandin/CAPAM
  cgrandin/IPHC
  cgrandin/IPHC-developer
  cgrandin/LNclass
  cgrandin/PacificHerring
  cgrandin/SOKherring
  cgrandin/SilverHake
  cgrandin/developer
  cgrandin/equilibrium
  cgrandin/gh-pages
  cgrandin/halibut
  cgrandin/master
  cgrandin/twoSexPar
  origin/CAPAM
  origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  origin/IPHC
  origin/IPHC-developer
  origin/LNclass
  origin/PacificHerring
  origin/SOKherring
  origin/SilverHake
  origin/developer
  origin/equilibrium
  origin/gh-pages
  origin/halibut
  origin/master
  origin/twoSexPar

If you are missing IPHC-developer or any other branches at this early stage just re-clone and start this over.

You must now create a local branch based on your origin/IPHC-developer:

git checkout -b IPHC-developer origin/IPHC-developer
or using the alias:
git cb IPHC-developer origin/IPHC-developer

Make sure it is there:
git branch
git checkout IPHC-developer

You should now be in the branch IPHC-developer
Now, merge my changes, becuase I got the compilation working for iscam.tpl:

git merge cgrandin/IPHC-developer

Now merge Steve's changes:

git merge smartell/IPHC-developer

To merge in specific commits from Steve's (or anyone's) repository, use git cherry-pick SHA
This is a good webpage to get started on that:
